Explain one limitation of RSA protocol attacks.

Answer:
The limitation of RSA protocol attacks is in its specific condition required for it to work. 
The man in the middle (MITM) attack on RSA protocol require the protocol to send an encrypted message without padding and without a signature to authenticate it.
This means that if padding was added such as the case in part 5 of this lab, or if a signature is used to authenticate the message sent, then a MITM attack will not work anymore.
